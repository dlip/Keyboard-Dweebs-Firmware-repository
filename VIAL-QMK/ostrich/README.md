If you use the "Lower" "Raise" "Adjust" using the [tri_layer_state function](https://docs.splitkb.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018614379-Using-tri-state-layers), then you would need to use the "Tri_Layer_State" UF2. 

As far as I am aware it has to be compiled this way for it to function correctly. There is no way to add this is with the tools that are provided to your in Vial.

Just for awareness, layer 0 would be the "lower" layer, layer 1 would be the "Raise" layer, and layer 2 is the "Adjust" layer.

I also uploaded the keyboard folder from vial-qmk in case you would like to compile it yourself.
